# useful_scripts
A collection of scripts made for different purposes. Some of these were made for my own personal use-cases, others were made for specific courses in University. These scripts are made mostly in python, but there are also some batch, bash and other scripts. If you find anything that could be improved in any of these scripts, please let me know.
